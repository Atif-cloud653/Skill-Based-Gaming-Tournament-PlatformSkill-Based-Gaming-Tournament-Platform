# Skill-Based Gaming Tournament Platform

## Project Description

The Skill-Based Gaming Tournament Platform is a decentralized blockchain-based solution that revolutionizes competitive gaming by providing a transparent, secure, and fair environment for organizing and participating in skill-based tournaments. Built on Ethereum using Solidity smart contracts, this platform eliminates the need for intermediaries while ensuring trustless prize distribution and maintaining player skill ratings.

The platform enables game organizers to create tournaments with customizable entry fees, participant limits, and durations, while players can join tournaments, compete, and earn rewards based on their performance. All transactions and outcomes are recorded immutably on the blockchain, providing complete transparency and preventing fraud.
